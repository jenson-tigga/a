          <h3>Dear you</h3>
          <p>If you are out there and you're dealing I want to say this. Dear person, I know it sucks. I know it's scary, I know you feel like the undertow is pulling you in, and I know that you feel like drowning. And I'm sorry that you have to deal with it all. I want to tell you, that things will get better soon but I don't know your life story, I don't know your struggle, I don't know the severity of your illness and I cannot make you a patronizing promise like that. What I can say is that, hopefully, one day at some point in your future it will get better. That one point when you feel like giving up just remember that somewhere in your future maybe not tomorrow, maybe not day after, maybe not next year. But somewhere in your future, a day is waiting. And it is a simple and ordinary and profound day where you'll get one little thing right -like you'll make the perfect cup of tea, or sun and the wind will hit your face in that perfectly way that makes you want to take a lovely nap. Or a friend will tell a joke that will make you burst out in laughter... and in that second, on that day a voice in your head will say "I'm glad I stuck around for this. I'm glad, I fought off the abyss, I'm glad that I started it down and I'm glad that I'm here." I will also tell you that day will not last and it will go away. And for every good day there will be another bad one. Because this is who we are. We will wonder between the darkness and the light and that's okay. And when you feel like you're weak or at your weakest and you should give up, remember that you might think you are weak but you are someone else's source of strength whether you know it or not. And what we have, what we deal with, what we live with it isn't always nice and it isn't always pretty but.. It is. You are and you really should stay.
